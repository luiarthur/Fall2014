Data: Car Crash datafrom Federal Highway Administration (2012)

The goal of this study is to understand the relationship between X (several
independent variables) and the log odds of having at least one fatality in a
vehicle using bayesian statistics. The dataset consists of an indicator of
fatality (0,1) in a car accident and 23 other independent variables, some of
which are categorical. Logistic regression will be used for modelling the log
odds of death.
