\section{Summary of the Paper}
Gelman reviews the multilevel (hierarchical) model using a radon-measurement
dataset from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). He demonstrates that
using the hierarchical model is almost always an improvement from classical
regression, and shows when it is essential, useful, or only helpful.\\

\noindent
Of interest to the EPA is the distribution of radon levels across homes in the
US. Radon is a carcinogenic gas that causes several thousand lung cancer deaths
each year. It is known that radon comes from underground and enters more easily
into homes that are built into the ground, or that have basements.
Consequently, the presence of basements in homes an important predictor for
radon levels. In addition, uranuim, a solid that exists in soil, is a parent
element that eventually decays to form radon gas. So, soil uranium measurements
are also an important predictor of radon levels. The dataset from the EPA 
contains information on more than 80,000 houses throughout the country. But
Gelman analyzes only data in Minnesota, and groups observations (to form a
hierarchy) by county, within the state of Minnesota.\\

\noindent
The hierarchical model that Gelman fits is
\begin{align*}
  y_{ij}      &\sim \text{N}(\alpha_j + \beta x_{ij},\sigma_y^2),
               \text{ for }i=1,...,n_j,~j=1,...J.\\
  \alpha_{ij} &\sim \text{N}(\gamma_0 + \gamma_1 u_j,\sigma_a^2),
               \text{ for }j=1,...,J,\\
\end{align*}
where $y_{ij}$ is the \textit{log} radon measurement in house $i$ within county
$j$, $x_{ij}$ is an indicator (0 for ``No", 1 for ``Yes") for whether house $i$
in county $j$ has a basement, $u_j$ is the \textit{log} soil uranium
measurement in county $j$. Consequently, the interpretation of $\alpha_j$ would
be the expected \textit{log} radon measurement in a houses without basements in
county $j$ (within Minnesota). Instead of interpreting $\beta$, it may be more
informing to interpret $\alpha_j+\beta$, which is the the expected \textit{log}
radon measurement in a houses with basements in county $j$. $\gamma_0$ is the
expected \textit{log} radon measurement in houses without basements in
Minnesota when county uranium level is 1. $\gamma_1$ is the expected increase
in \textit{log} radon measurement in houses in county $j$ when county $j$'s
uranium measurement increase by $e\approx 2.718$. $\sigma_y^2$ is the variation
that exists between houses within county $j$. Finally, $\sigma_a^2$ is the
variation that exists between baseline \textit{log} radon measurements between
different counties in Minnesota.\\
